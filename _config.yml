          In my thesis "<i>Interpreting KV Cache Compression Methods in Modern LLMs</i>" I investigated a largely unexplored intersection between two research fields on LLMs: applying automated mechanistic interpretability techniques to understand KV cache compression methods, an important optimization for LLMs. In particular, I studied if it is possible to obtain natural language explanations for the behavior of those compression methods, and if those can give insights on how to improve such methods.

          I adapted the Delphi automated interpretability framework to analyze Q-Filters, a recently proposed KV cache compression technique that leverages query-key geometry for compression, while maintaining compatibility with critical optimizations for LLMs like FlashAttention. The findings indicate that Q-Filters encode interpretable patterns on what is to be removed, in particular global mechanisms that systematically deprioritize structural tokens such as punctuation, formatting elements, prepositions, and other syntactically predictable components that carry minimal semantic content.

          This study represents the first application of mechanistic interpretability to KV cache compression techniques.

          During my Honours Programme's activity I was supervised by professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/paolodilorenzohp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paolo di Lorenzo</a> and I worked on the topic of Semantic Communications, related to the work on AI-native communications for the forthcoming 6G network infrastructure.
          
          I attended additional Master and PhD-level courses about Internet of Things (IoT), Smart Enviroments and Generative Deep Learning, alongside the standard curriculum of my Master's Degree program. I have also conducted research activity on the topic, working on Latent Space Alignment of Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding models.

          My work culminated in the publication together with the SPAICOM Lab of Sapienza of the paper "<i>Semantic Channel Equalization Strategies for Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding</i>", of which I am first author and which was submitted and accepted at the IEEE Global Communications Conference of 2025 in the workshop of "AI native Communications Systems - Towards Integrated Intelligent and Highly Efficient Systems".

          Recipient of "<i>Outstanding student</i>" merits from Sapienza University.

          ---

          In my thesis "<i>Generazione e Utilizzo di Dati Sintetici da Scene Tridimensionali per l'Object Detection</i>" (<i>Generating and Using Synthetic Data from Three-Dimensional Scenes for Object Detection</i>) I explored the generation of synthetic data from 3D environments to mitigate the domain shift between training and test data in the setting of precision agriculture.
          
          Using NVIDIA Omniverse, I created synthetic datasets of grape clusters images and combined them with real-world data to train YOLOv5 object detection models.
          
          The results demonstrated that synthetic data effectively reduced the domain gap, improving object detection accuracy in the target environment. Additionally, I achieved a small performance boost even within the original domain, highlighting the broader potential of synthetic data in supervised learning for computer vision tasks.

          In this project I use complex systems and network analysis tools to investigate how the behavior of users on the website StackOverflow changed since the diffusion of LLMs at the end of 2022. In particular, I studied how the networks of users and questions evolved over time and how the type and the complexity of questions changed.

          My results show that while the network was already declining the diffusion of LLMs sped-up the phenomenon while also greatly increasing the complexity of the questions and how niche their topic is, which together with a decline in questions suggests that users may first ask questions to LLMs and if not satisfied, search for help on the website.

          I developed an interactive web-based visualization tool for external sorting algorithms: 2-way merge-sort and its generalization into k-way merge-sort. The tool provides an interface where the user selects the number of input pages, frames and the amount elements per page.
          
          The application provides an animation that makes clear each external memory access and each operation inside the buffer, while also keeping a log about what is happening and recording useful metrics about the execution. The aim of this tool is to help students understand the mechanics of external sorting algorithms with a clean and simple animation, highlighting the difference with more classic main-memory sorting algorithms.

          I implemented from scratch in JAX the distribuited training and inference algorithms for Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) described in the paper "<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9303371" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Distributed Training of Graph Convolutional Networks</i></a>", a distribuied optimization scenario where each agent has data about a part of a graph and they agents that communicate over a sparse network topology.
          
          I also compared their performances on different datasets varying the amount of agents and against the non-distribuited implementation, which code I also wrote from scratch in JAX.

          My team and I conducted a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art disease gene prioritization algorithms (e.g. DIAMOnD, DiaBLE) and applied them to retinal dystrophy data, with the primary objective of drug repurposing.
          
          We carried out every stage of the pipeline, including data preprocessing, algorithm implementation, and result interpretation. Our findings were then synthesized into a comprehensive report.

          I implemented from scratch in JAX all the layers and optimization algorithms for an LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network, including LSTM layers, embedding layers, dropout layers and the RMSprop training algorithm. The network is trained for the autoregressive task of music generation on a large collection of tokenized MIDI files, resulting in 24 million training samples.

          Listenable examples are provided by processing converting the generated sequences back into MIDI files and converting them into audio using a music synthesizer.

          I designed and implemented a scenario to confront two well-known data center networking topologies for distribuited computing (Fat-Tree and Jellyfish), against a baseline of a non-distribuited computation. Using simulations I obtained data about their job running cost including overhead and mean response time varying the amount of servers and summarized my findings in plots.

          During my 4th year of high school as part of "Percorsi per le Competenze Trasversali e per l'Orientamento" (<i>Paths for transversal skills and orientation</i>) I have been selected as a representative for my school for the project "Da Grande Farò il Biologo", hosted by Roma Tre university's biology department.

          The project consisted in a full-time week of lectures and laboratory sessions made by biology professors from the university and ended with a final examination. Thanks to my score in the evaluation I have been awarded the possibility of entering the bachelor's course of biology at Roma Tre university without taking the admission test.
