          In my thesis "<i>Generating and Using Synthetic Data from Three-Dimensional Scenes for Object Detection</i>" I explored the generation of synthetic data from 3D environments to mitigate the domain shift between training and test data in the setting of precision agriculture. Using NVIDIA Omniverse, I created synthetic datasets of grape clusters and combined them with real-world data to train YOLOv5 object detection models.
          
          The results demonstrated that synthetic data effectively reduced the domain gap, improving object detection accuracy in the target environment. Additionally, I achieved a small performance boost even within the original domain, highlighting the broader potential of synthetic data in supervised learning for computer vision tasks.

        link_text: Github repository
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I implemented from scratch in JAX the distribuited training and inference algorithms for graph convolutional networks described in the paper "<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9303371" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Distributed Training of Graph Convolutional Networks</i></a>" and compared their performances on different datasets varying the amount of agents and against the non-distribuited implementation.

        link_text: Github repository
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I implemented from scratch in JAX all the layers and optimization algorithms for a LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network and trained it on a large collection of tokenized MIDI files for the autoregressive task of music generation. Listenable examples are provided by processing the generated sequences with a music synthesizer.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I implemented from scratch in Python the components required for Yao's Garbled Circuits, a cryptographic protocol for secure two-party computation, including socket communication and cryptographic primitives as asymmetric encryption and Oblivious Transfer. The result of many different example circuits are provided as integer and float operations, hashing, encryption and coin tossing.

          During my 4th year of high school as part of "Percorsi per le Competenze Trasversali e per l'Orientamento" (<i>Paths for transversal skills and orientation</i>) I have been selected as a representative for my school for the project "Da Grande Farò il Biologo", hosted by Roma Tre university.

          The project consisted in a full-time week of lectures and laboratory sessions made by biology professors of the university and ended with a final examination. Thanks to my score in the evaluation I have been awarded the possibility of entering the Bachelor's course of Biology at Roma Tre without performing the admission test.
